# Menumemory

Menumemory is an app for jotting down your dining experiences at restaurants. It let's you add a review for every dish you had at a restaurant visit so that the next time you go to same restaurant (say, a few months later) you do not need to wonder which dishes are good and which are not, you can look up what you thought about the dish on your last visit. And if enough people are using the app, you can also see what someone who last ate the same dish at that restaurant thought about it too.

Here is a link to the intended frontend UI design:  https://www.figma.com/design/soNxFzBVn5t5vZrbkTjCnu/Restaurant-Visit-Tracker?node-id=0-1&t=nMHPID03iy7o1oJM-1
